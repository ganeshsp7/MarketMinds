[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)]

MarketMinds is a lightweight **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** toolset to support financial research. It includes tools for backtesting trades, fetching market data, and retrieving company news for sentiment analysis‚Äîideal for integrating with LLMs like Claude.

##  ‚ú®  Features

- **BackTest Simulation** (`backtest_simulation.py`):  
  Compute historical buy/sell price performance and PnL percentage for stock symbols (via yfinance).

- **Financial Analysis Server** (`financial_analysis_server.py`):  
  An MCP server offering on-demand access to financial metrics, charts, and other market data.

- **Sentiment News Fetcher** (`sentiment_analysis.py`):  
  Fetch recent news articles for a given company using NewsAPI‚Äîperfect for feeding into LLMs for sentiment-based investing decisions.

## ‚ö° Installation

Use `uv` package manager to install dependencies:

```bash
uv add fastmcp yfinance requests python-dotenv
```

Or install manually:
```bash
pip install fastmcp yfinance requests python-dotenv
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
1. Create a .env file in the project root containing your NewsAPI key:
    ```bash
    NEWS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
2. (Optional) Use pyproject.toml to define entry points or CLI commands for each tool.


## üöÄ Installing and Running MCP Tools (Installing Directly via uv run mcp install)
After creating your tools (backtest_simulation.py, financial_analysis_server.py, sentiment_analysis.py), you can register them with Claude using uv:


1. BackTest Simulation
     ```bash
    uv run mcp install backtest_simulation.py
    ```
    This command adds the Python script backtest_simulation.py to the MCP framework as a tool, enabling Claude to invoke it during its operations.
    After execution, the output will look similar to:
    ``` bash
    Added server 'BackTest_Simulation' to Claude config
    INFO Successfully installed Market_News_Fetcher in Claude app
    ```


2. Financial Analysis Server
    ```bash
    uv run mcp install financial_analysis_server.py
    ```
    This command adds the Python script financial_analysis_server.py to the MCP framework as a tool, enabling Claude to invoke it during its operations.
     After execution, the output will look similar to:
    ``` bash
    Added server 'financial_analysis' to Claude config
    INFO Successfully installed Market_News_Fetcher in Claude app
    ```

3. Sentiment News Fetcher
    ``` bash
    uv run mcp install sentiment_analysis.py
    ```
    This command adds the Python script sentiment_analysis.py to the MCP framework as a tool, enabling Claude to invoke it during its operations.
     After execution, the output will look similar to:
    ``` bash
    Added server 'Market_News_Fetcher' to Claude config
    INFO Successfully installed Market_News_Fetcher in Claude app
    ```




üí° Tip: Make sure your .env contains the NEWS_API_KEY and that it‚Äôs loaded (e.g., via python-dotenv) so the news fetcher works properly.
